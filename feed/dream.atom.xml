The two parts were happening kind-of parallely,
but I'll narrate them sequentially for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-1"&gt;Part 1&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#part-1" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my friends' place expanded from a 2-bedroom apartment to a large mansion/dorm.
Many people were living in it: I, some of my friends, and a few strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a large almost-empty room somewhere in his mansion.
The only furniture in that room was two maroon 3-seater sofas on opposite ends of the room.
I played indoor soccer in that room against a woman, treating the sofas as goals.
That woman is a senior professor at a large US university
(I know who she is but I've never talked to her and I won't name her here).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the game ended, I got hungry and went to the kitchen to have breakfast.
The kitchen was very dirty.
I don't know why, but I had a sudden urge to clean the place before having breakfast.
I washed dishes, cleaned the stove, took out the trash,
threw expired stuff from the fridge, etc.
But even after spending what felt like an eternity, there was still a lot more to be done!
It was as if the kitchen was magically dirtying itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-2"&gt;Part 2&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#part-2" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was in high school (in Delhi). It was winter and I was feeling cold.
A mysterious person offered me a black hoodie.
I took it and put it on without asking any questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to the sports ground and students saw that large
ice &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalagmite"&gt;Stalagmites&lt;/a&gt; had formed on the floor.
Students started hurling them in the air like Javelins in random directions.
It was like the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgJIa3-bv74&amp;amp;t=644s"&gt;unofficial IISc Holi celebration&lt;/a&gt;,
but with a lot less people and ice javelins instead of clothes.
I had to keep dodging them to prevent getting impaled.
I kept telling them this is a bad idea but they all ignored me.
I ran to an edge of the field to reduce the variance in directions of javelins approaching me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then an alien spaceship arrived (stereotypically circular in shape).
It started shooting bombs and lasers at us.
I realized that people wearing black hoodies were unaffected by its lasers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="Dream"></category></entry><entry><title>Weird dream</title><link href="https://sharmaeklavya2.github.io/blog/dream1.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-11-10T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2020-11-10T00:00:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Eklavya Sharma</name></author><id>tag:sharmaeklavya2.github.io,2020-11-10:/blog/dream1.html</id><summary type="html"></summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had a weird 2-part dream today. Here's what happened in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-1"&gt;Part 1&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#part-1" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to get
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin"&gt;Vladimir Putin&lt;/a&gt;'s signature
on a document (I don't remember why). So he visited my house.
I went to my room to get the form, but I couldn't find it,
even after looking everywhere in my room.
I told him that I couldn't find the form, so I would print another one.
But my printer refused to print because it was low on cyan,
even though the form was completely black-and-white.
I troubleshooted the printer while Putin patiently waited behind me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I'm not a Putin fan. I'm not interested in or aware of Russian politics.
Then why was Putin in my dreams? I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="part-2"&gt;Part 2&lt;a class="headerlink" href="#part-2" title="Permanent link"&gt;&amp;para;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was attending a lecture at a university.
There was a loud noise outside, so all the students rushed out to see what's going on.
It turns out that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraswati"&gt;Saraswati Devi&lt;/a&gt; had
come flying on a huge swan and landed near our lecture building.
Then &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frozen_(2013_film)"&gt;Elsa and Anna&lt;/a&gt;
come out of their labs, hop on the huge swan, and leave with Saraswati.
We get to know that Elsa and Anna are actually PhD students in our university's
biology department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An animal (either an owl or a deer or a human; I forgot which exactly)
walks up to us, claiming to be an agent of Saraswati.
He claims that Elsa and Anna have been chosen by God to complete holy quests.
He offers monetary remuneration to Elsa and Anna's advisor.
The advisor cries, "What will I do with money? You took away my best PhD students.
I may have to restart my experiments from scratch. How will I get
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_tenure"&gt;tenure&lt;/a&gt; now?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I'm not a religious person or a Frozen fan.
Then why were Saraswati and Elsa in my dreams? I have no idea.
Also, I don't think tenure works like that.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="posts"></category><category term="Dream"></category></entry></feed>
