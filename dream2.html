<p>I had a weird 2-part dream today.
The two parts were happening kind-of parallely,
but I'll narrate them sequentially for clarity.</p>
<h2 id="part-1">Part 1<a class="headerlink" href="#part-1" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>One of my friends' place expanded from a 2-bedroom apartment to a large mansion/dorm.
Many people were living in it: I, some of my friends, and a few strangers.</p>
<p>There was a large almost-empty room somewhere in his mansion.
The only furniture in that room was two maroon 3-seater sofas on opposite ends of the room.
I played indoor soccer in that room against a woman, treating the sofas as goals.
That woman is a senior professor at a large US university
(I know who she is but I've never talked to her and I won't name her here).</p>
<p>After the game ended, I got hungry and went to the kitchen to have breakfast.
The kitchen was very dirty.
I don't know why, but I had a sudden urge to clean the place before having breakfast.
I washed dishes, cleaned the stove, took out the trash,
threw expired stuff from the fridge, etc.
But even after spending what felt like an eternity, there was still a lot more to be done!
It was as if the kitchen was magically dirtying itself.</p>
<h2 id="part-2">Part 2<a class="headerlink" href="#part-2" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>I was in high school (in Delhi). It was winter and I was feeling cold.
A mysterious person offered me a black hoodie.
I took it and put it on without asking any questions.</p>
<p>We went to the sports ground and students saw that large
ice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalagmite">Stalagmites</a> had formed on the floor.
Students started hurling them in the air like Javelins in random directions.
It was like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgJIa3-bv74&amp;t=644s">unofficial IISc Holi celebration</a>,
but with a lot less people and ice javelins instead of clothes.
I had to keep dodging them to prevent getting impaled.
I kept telling them this is a bad idea but they all ignored me.
I ran to an edge of the field to reduce the variance in directions of javelins approaching me.</p>
<p>Then an alien spaceship arrived (stereotypically circular in shape).
It started shooting bombs and lasers at us.
I realized that people wearing black hoodies were unaffected by its lasers.</p>
