<p>3 balls in 1 hand, a.k.a. 3-in-1, is definitely not an easy pattern,
mostly because of the speed, accuracy and strength required to do it.
I could learn to do it because I came up with good prerequisites.
It still took me a few months to learn it (which is much more than the average time I take to learn a pattern),
and I still haven't mastered it.</p>
<p>Throughout this article, I'll assume that you want to juggle 3 balls in your right hand.
If you want to juggle with your left hand, just mirror-invert all instructions here.
In all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siteswap">siteswaps</a> mentioned here,
the first throw will be from the right hand.</p>
<p>First of all, you should have mastered the 3 ball shower (siteswap <code>51</code>) to almost perfection.
There are 2 mirror-images of the shower.
You must perfect the one where the left hand makes the horizontal pass
(i.e. siteswap <code>51</code>, not <code>15</code>).</p>
<p>Then you must learn to make a type-6 throw.
While juggling <code>51</code>, replace one of the type-5 throws by a type-6 throw.
It'll look similar to <code>6151505151515151</code>.</p>

<p>Practice this until you find it easy to replace a type-5 throw by a type-6 throw.</p>
<p>Now practice <code>615150</code>, then <code>6051</code>, then <code>61615050</code> and then <code>606150</code>.</p>

<p>You might also want to try out other variations.
After you get good at these, you can finally try 3-in-1.</p>
