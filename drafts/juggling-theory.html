<p>This post explains the surprising link between math and juggling.
Juggling theory is a beautiful example of how we can get more insight in
a seemingly non-mathematical area by building a theory and proving stuff.</p>
<p>This post doesn't assume any mathematical background, except that
the last few theorems employ elementary graph theory and number theory.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-juggling">What is Juggling?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-juggling" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Juggling is a recreational activity where a person manipulates multiple objects
by repeatedly throwing and catching them.
If you haven't seen professional juggling before, I highly recommend watching this
<a href="https://youtu.be/wP8tbLBls_M?t=362" target="_blank">amazing performance by Anthony Gatto</a>.</p>
<p>There are different <em>patterns</em> in juggling.
The animations below depict three well-known patterns:
cascade, shower and fountain.</p>

</div>

<p>The fundamental problem in juggling theory is how to succinctly describe a juggling pattern.
I used GIF animations above to explain to you what cascade, shower and fountain mean,
but we are interested in a way of representing juggling patterns
that is much smaller (just a few characters long),
reveals the <em>structure</em> of the pattern
and can be read and analyzed by machines.
In 1981, Paul Klimek invented a way of representing juggling patterns
as a sequence of integers. His notation is called <em>siteswap</em>.</p>
<p>An amazing by-product of having such a notation is the ability to
automate the process of inventing new patterns
by brute-force enumeration of integer sequences.
Previously, only non-beginner jugglers could invent patterns using hit-and-trial.</p>
<p>Another advantage of siteswaps is that they can be used as input to
programs that create animations of juggling patterns.
In fact, that is exactly how I created the above GIFs,
using <a href="https://jugglinglab.org/" target="_blank">Juggling Lab</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-features-of-a-juggling-pattern">The features of a juggling pattern<a class="headerlink" href="#the-features-of-a-juggling-pattern" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>There are some assumptions that we'll impose on juggling patterns.
These set of assumptions define our <em>model</em>.
Here we will look at a model that is powerful enough to capture most of the well-known patterns
and at the same time is simple enough to analyze.</p>
<p>Our first assumption is that we'll only look at patterns in the <em>steady state</em>,
i.e. we won't worry about how the juggler <em>started</em> juggling.
Alternatively, we can assume that the juggler started juggling at time <span class="math">\(t=-\infty\)</span>
and will continue to juggle till time <span class="math">\(t=\infty\)</span>.</p>
<p>A juggling pattern consists of several features that are orthogonal,
i.e. the features can be varied independently of each other.
We'll discuss some of the important features here, one of which is siteswap.
We'll start with features that are easy to understand,
and then move on to more complex but more important features.</p>
<h3 id="speed">Speed<a class="headerlink" href="#speed" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Every pattern can be made slower by throwing the balls higher.</p>

    <figcaption>Slow cascade</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p><strong>Assumption</strong>: <em>all throws are made at integral units of time.</em></p>
<p>A unit of time is called a <em>tick</em> or a <em>beat</em>.
The speed of a pattern is defined by the duration of a tick in seconds.</p>
<h3 id="dwell">Dwell<a class="headerlink" href="#dwell" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The amount of time the juggler holds a ball in his/her hand is called <em>dwell</em>.
Dwell is measured in ticks.
Using a large dwell is called <em>lazy style</em>
and using a small dwell is called <em>hot-potato style</em>.</p>
<div class="gallery">

    <figcaption>Hot-potato cascade</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>For simplicity of presentation, assume that the dwell is the same for all throws/catches.</p>
<h3 id="hand-position">Hand position<a class="headerlink" href="#hand-position" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>A pattern can be modified by changing the positions of hands during throws and catches.
Hand positions can be specified using a coordinate system.
(A standard practice is that the coordinate system for the right hand
is the mirror image of the coordinate system for the left hand.)</p>

    <img src="https://sharmaeklavya2.github.io/blog/img/siteswaps/3-out.gif" />
    <figcaption>Reverse cascade</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>Reverse cascade is similar to the normal cascade,
except that instead of throwing from the inside and catching on the outside,
we throw from the outside and catch on the inside.
(A careful observation will reveal that the reverse cascade is actually a time-reversed
version of the normal cascade.)</p>
<p>The above examples use static hand positioning, i.e.
all throw positions are the same and all catch positions are the same.
We can get nice variations of the cascade, which don't really look like the cascade,
by using dynamic hand positioning.</p>

<p>As stated before, hand positioning is independent of other features of the pattern.
As an example, here are some hand positions applied to the fountain pattern:</p>

<h3 id="siteswap">Siteswap<a class="headerlink" href="#siteswap" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>If you look at the first three animations (cascade, shower, fountain),
they have the same hand-positioning and can be made to have the same speed and dwell.
Yet these patterns look very different.
The feature that differentiates them is the order in which objects are thrown and caught.
This information is captured by siteswap.
This is where things start getting mathematical!</p>
<p><strong>Assumption</strong>: <em>hands throw alternately</em>, i.e. at even ticks, the left hand throws
and at odd ticks, the right hand throws. This assumption is called <em>asynchronicity</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Assumption</strong>: <em>a hand can only hold 1 ball at a time.</em>
This restriction is called <em>non-multiplexing</em>.
(Most non-jugglers assume that non-multiplexing is mandatory for juggling,
but that's not always true.)</p>
<p>If all the other features (ticks per second, dwell, hand position) are fixed,
then a juggling pattern can be uniquely determined by specifying two things for each throw:</p>
<ul>
<li>The order of the throw, which is the flight-time of a throw in ticks,
plus the dwell. <strong>Assumption</strong>: <em>throw orders are integers.</em></li>
<li>Whether the ball is thrown to the same hand or to a different hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not hard to observe that the order of a throw is odd
iff it is thrown to a different hand.
This is because if an object is thrown at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> and has order <span class="math">\(x\)</span>,
then it will be thrown next at time <span class="math">\(t+x\)</span>.
Since hands throw alternately, an odd <span class="math">\(x\)</span> will change the throwing hand.
Therefore, to specify a throw, we only need to specify the order of every throw.</p>
<p><strong>Assumption</strong>: <em>patterns are periodic.</em>
So, we only need to state the smallest repeating subsequence
of the infinite sequence of throw orders.
This finite-sized subsequence is called siteswap.
The length of this subsequence is called the period of the siteswap.</p>
<p>Looking at a pattern and figuring out its siteswap
can be tricky at first, especially if you're new to juggling.
I'll show some examples, and explain what a ladder diagram is,
so that you get comfortable with the concept of siteswap.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-valid-siteswap-incomplete">What is a valid siteswap? (Incomplete)<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-valid-siteswap-incomplete" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>An arbitrary sequence of integers isn't necessarily the siteswap of a pattern.
We'll now look at an algorithm for determining if an integer sequence is a valid siteswap.</p>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: Let <span class="math">\(a\)</span> be an integer sequence of length <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.
For each <span class="math">\(i\)</span>, let <span class="math">\(b_i = a_i \bmod n\)</span>. Then <span class="math">\(a\)</span> is a valid siteswap iff
<span class="math">\(b\)</span> is a permutation of <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}_n = \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="other-properties-of-a-siteswap-incomplete">Other properties of a siteswap (Incomplete)<a class="headerlink" href="#other-properties-of-a-siteswap-incomplete" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><strong>Theorem</strong>: Let <span class="math">\(a\)</span> be a siteswap of period <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.
Then the number of objects being juggled is <span class="math">\((\sum_{i=1}^n a_i)/n\)</span>.</p>
