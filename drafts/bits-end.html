        <p>I joined BITS Pilani as a B.E. Computer Science student in August 2014,
and now my college days have come to an end.
(Technically, I have a semester left, which I'll spend doing an internship (Practice School 2)
in American Express Gurgaon, but that's not going to feel like college.)
I have learned a lot in these three-and-a-half years;
not just computer science, but many other things. I'm a changed person now.</p>
<p>However, my student life in BITS Pilani didn't go exactly as planned.
There are many things I learned the hard way.
There were many opportunities for which I was too late.
I wish I had someone who could guide me correctly.
I had seniors who could have done that, and they did help.
But that wasn't enough because most of them were just a year older than me
and couldn't see that far ahead.
But more importantly, I didn't know that their experience could
have had such a positive impact, so I didn't bother asking for help.
I thought I was doing fine by myself.</p>
<p>This article is written as advice to my past self.
I hope it'll be a useful read for someone like me who has just started college
or is about to start college and wants to pursue a career in computer science.
It's likely that you're very different from my past self,
so some of this post won't apply to you.
But some of this advice is general and will apply to most computer science students.
I'll generally give reasons why I recommend something,
so that you know what's relevant to you.</p>
<p>A bit about my past self - just before I joined BITS,
I had sufficient programming experience in C++ from high school.
This means I had the capability to write a program for almost any algorithm I could imagine.
I used to have a strong liking for math, and I still do.</p>
<h1>Career advice</h1>
<p>Keep in touch with seniors, preferably those who seem to be interested in the
same areas as you and those who might have the same career goals as you.
They will be of great help.</p>
<p>You have 2 career options as far as I know - working in an IT company or doing research (either academic or industrial).
(There are others, like entrepreneurship, but I'm quite confident my past self is neither capable
of nor interested in that).
Also, there are several areas in computer science where you can specialize -
machine learning, computer networks, CS theory, etc.
The earlier you can decide what you want to do, the better it will be for you.
But you can only decide and be confident about your choice after you try out different things.
Until then, you have to consider all possibilities.</p>
<p>Maintain a good CGPA. If you're looking a for a job, a CGPA above 8 is almost always sufficient.
If you want to pursue higher studies, try to keep your CGPA as high as you can and higher than 9 at all times.
It is easiest to score in the first year.</p>
<p>Doing projects is also important. If you participate in an APOGEE project,
make sure you have enough talented seniors in your team and the project
involves a branch of computer science in which you might be interested.
Avoid purely software-development projects.
Doing study oriented projects (SOPs) related to your fields of interest can be very helpful.
To do a SOP in the n<sup>th</sup> semester, you have to apply for it
roughly in the middle of the (n-1)<sup>th</sup> semester.
They can also help you get letters of recommendation from professors
(you'll need 3 of them to apply for masters).
You can also try getting into a CS lab (I haven't done it,
but I would have tried it if I knew about their existence in my first year).
If you do a project as part of a course, either do it so well
that you can put it on your resume, or do it in a way which
would fetch you sufficient marks without much effort,
or do it in a way which would help you explore that branch of computer science
and help you decide whether you would like to pursue it further or not.</p>
<p>Competitive programming will be very helpful if you want to clear job interviews
or you want to do algorithms related research.
But even if you don't want to do any of that, I recommend that you do competitive programming
for at least a year, since it will make you good at writing efficient programs quickly.
You should solve at least 5 problems every week.
The first year seems to be the best time to start competitive programming.</p>
<p>The first CS course you should do is DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms),
because this knowledge will be used in many different areas.
This is also very important for competitive programming.
You should preferably start it in the first year and finish it before the third semester ends.</p>
<p>Good software development practices, like version control and automated testing,
won't benefit you in job interviews or getting selected in a good college for higher studies.
But knowing them will help you whenever you do a project, so I recommend that you learn the basics.
But before you begin learning that, you should learn other important skills
which I have listed in a section below.</p>
<p>Getting a research intership in a well-known university as part of off-campus thesis
or during vacations could be a great way to get research experience.
I couldn't do it because I found out about them too late and then I got busy with other stuff.</p>
<h1>What you should get before entering BITS</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Laptop</strong> - You'll need it to code and to read stuff (like slides by professors and online tutorials).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gmail address</strong> - I can't really justify having it.
    But I found myself needing one soon and it was a chore to inform my contacts about my new gmail address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Facebook account</strong> - This is so that you can get event and group notifications.
    Some student clubs and workshops use it as their official medium of communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Smartphone</strong> - This isn't absolutely necessary but highly recommended.
    A smartphone can do many things for which you'll otherwise need a laptop.
    It can notify you when email arrives and sometimes important emails require action on short notice.
    Also, WhatsApp is a very popular medium of communication between students
    and WhatsApp can only be used on a smartphone. (There are exceptions, but only for power users).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1>What skills you should learn</h1>
<p>Apart from learning about computer science itself, you'll also need to learn about tools/skills
which will be useful for writing code and doing projects.
They're arranged in approximately chronological order in which you should learn them.
You should do a few of these things in parallel instead of doing them one-by-one.
It will take around 3 semesters for you to learn them all
(including 2 winter vacations and 1 summer vacation).
Start learning them as early as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Touch typing</strong>:
  Touch typing is the ability to type without looking at the keyboard.
  Most programmers spend a lot of time typing.
  Learning touch typing will not only improve your speed, but it will make typing very comfortable.
  It will enable words to flow freely from your mind on to the keyboard.
  You can find many websites dedicated to helping you learn and practice touch typing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>C++ STL</strong>:
  Knowing the basics of OOP and templates will help you use the STL,
  which is an important part of the C++ standard library.
  This will be very helpful in competitive programming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unix-like OS</strong>:
  Windows is the most popular operating system for desktops and laptops on earth,
  but it's not very programmer-friendly. You should either get a MacBook or install Linux.
  You'll realize the importance of this when you learn tools which don't have good-enough windows counterparts.
  Switching an operating system can be difficult at first, but you'll eventually get used to it.
  It's also possible to keep both Windows and Linux on the same computer
  and choose which operating system to load each time the computer starts.
  Installing Linux can be a daunting task, so take help from people who have done it before if you can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The terminal</strong>:
  Although GUI is more popular among lay people, being able to work on a terminal has several advantages.
  To use the terminal effectively, you must learn <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php">the shell</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>vim</strong> and <strong>tmux</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>HTML/CSS</strong> and <strong>Markdown</strong>:
  These are formats for writing rich text.
  They are good alternatives to WYSWIG editors like MS Word if you only want simple formatting.
  They are also easier to generate programmatically.
  Markdown is also used on Wikipedia, Github, Slack and many other places.
  Although there's a lot to learn in CSS, you only need to know the basics.
  You need not learn advanced stuff like animation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Python</strong>:
  Python is a popular programming language used in many domains.
  Unlike C and C++, it is very good for quick prototyping and experimentation.
  The range of libraries (both standard and third-party) available for python is probably unmatched
  by any other language and therefore it will often be easier to do your course projects using python.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from C++ and STL (used in competitive programming),
you probably haven't been able to put your skills to test until now.
Doing a software development project will help you do that.
There are many options available - web development, app development, etc.
I started with backend web development using Python and Django.
You can use this opportunity to learn about software-development practices like
version control (git), automated testing, build automation, etc.
Don't do very big or ambitious projects at this stage and do just 1 or 2 projects.
You're doing this so that you learn the basics of software development
and you get an estimate of how interesting or boring it is.</p>
<h1>Miscellaneous advice</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Get a dongle or inexpensive 4G mobile data.
  BITS internet is slow and unreliable. BITS also blocks or throttles some connections.
  Currently (December 2017) WhatsApp and codeforces are blocked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Log all your activities.
  This will enable you to know how much time you spend studying and how much time you waste everyday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Plan electives for all years before 2nd year begins, because electives are seasonal
  and prone to clash and you might not get a good priority number every time.
  Sometimes a not-so-good professor is allotted a course.
  You'll probably want to wait and take the course later when this happens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Record your Linux customizations.
  Otherwise you'll have to search stackexchange or ubuntuforums every time you upgrade your OS,
  work on a CS lab computer or help a friend customize his/her computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid taking all humanities electives in the beginning.
  Humanities electives are difficult to score in (at least for my past self),
  but it's also okay to score less in them.
  Therefore, taking a humanities elective instead of a disciplinary elective will make the semester lighter.
  The third year is the busiest part of BITSian life, so it makes sense to take a few humanities electives then.</p>
