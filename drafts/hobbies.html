        <p>Here's an attempt to exhaustively document my hobbies, interests and preferences.
In each section, things are arranged in roughly decreasing order of relevance.</p>
<p>Sometimes you may not know what something means exactly.
Looking it up on Wikipedia will often give you a good idea.
For things whose Wikipedia articles may not be well written,
I'll provide other references.</p>
<h2>Interests</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Structures, Algorithms and Theoretical Computer Science</strong>:
  For those who have no idea what the word 'Algorithm' means, look it up on the
  <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">simple English Wikipedia</a>.
  I started studying DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) in my first year at BITS
  so that I could become better at competitive programming.
  But in my second year I developed a liking for it by itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Competitive Programming</strong>:
  I started solving problems on <a href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> when I was in class 12.
  I didn't do it much then because I was also studying for engineering entrance exams.
  I solved algorithmic programming problems mostly in my first year.
  I occasionally still solve problems on <a href="https://www.codechef.com">Codechef</a> and <a href="http://codeforces.com">Codeforces</a>.
  Although this is my favorite pastime, I didn't do it much while I was in BITS
  (compared to others in BITS) because I was busy with other things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Math</strong>: Mostly Number Theory and recently Abstract Algebra.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Juggling</strong>:
  I started juggling after my entrance exams and before joining BITS.
  I know over 30 juggling patterns now. You can watch me juggle on
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHr2-w0mQrk&amp;list=PLUFqnl0Lfwwznpx15zIcBgzq4HsXLfLel">YouTube</a>.
  One of my first inspirations was this great
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP8tbLBls_M">juggling video of Anthony Gatto</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anime</strong>:
  I have watched 'Death Note', 'Attack on Titan' and 'The Last Airbender'.
  Do not look them up on Wikipedia or something if you don't want spoilers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Webcomics</strong>:
  Webcomics are comic strips put up on websites.
  I like <a href="https://xkcd.com">XKCD</a>, <a href="https://smbc-comics.com">SMBC</a> and <a href="https://www.jspowerhour.com">JSPH</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Software development</strong>:
  See <a href="https://github.com/sharmaeklavya2">my Github profile</a> for projects I have done.
  It used to be my primary hobby in my sophomore year at BITS but I'm no longer as interested in it now.
  I still like to do it occasionally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Video games</strong>:
  I used to play a lot of video games before college
  (my favorites include Rally racing, GTA Vice City, Croc and Jazz Jackrabbit)
  but I stopped after that mostly because I have been busy and I no longer have Windows.
  Sometimes I play strategy mini-games like <a href="https://alexnisnevich.github.io/untrusted/">Untrusted</a>
  and <a href="http://code.jerev.be/ggo13-transcube/">Transcube</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Balancing</strong>:
  In my third year at BITS, I learned how to balance long sticks on my foot, chin and nose.
  Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOju-b6JRxI">my video on YouTube</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cycling</strong>:
  I love cycling as a mode of transport. I used it to commute to classes at BITS.
  I wish cycling was safer on Delhi roads. I can cycle without holding the handle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Watching movies</strong>:
  I mostly watch English movies. I don't like romantic movies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dislikes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tourism</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Attending parties, dinners, etc.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Going to sleep at night and waking up in the morning</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preferences</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Music</strong>:
  I mostly like rock and some western classical.
  I also like Indian classical but good songs are harder to find in that category.
  Here are some of my favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Stage - Avenged Sevenfold</li>
<li>Mello theme - Death Note soundtrack</li>
<li>Hotel California - Eagles</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B4pZBmI_gU">Arpeggios from Hell</a></li>
<li>Mr Crowley - Ozzy Osbourne</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6y0eYcIJ5I">Minute Waltz - Chopin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWS1IRF_IFA">Angelina - Tommy Emmanuel</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5bzrB5QbSY">Cesar Frank Sonata</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sHURJwNjB8">Flight of the Bumblebee - Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov</a></li>
<li>River flows in you - Yiruma</li>
<li>Millennium of the Blind - Megadeth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Food</strong>:
  I'm vegetarian. South Indian food is my favorite.
  Very oily food makes me nauseous and some North Indian cuisines (especially that of Rajasthan) are very oily.
  I have recently developed a liking for 'oats in milk' as a quick snack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operating System</strong>:
  I strongly prefer Linux (all distributions I have ever seen) over Windows.
  Mac is good but I find Ubuntu Linux slightly better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Programming language</strong>:
  Python is my favorite for day-to-day programming and projects.
  For competitive programming, I use C/C++. I also know Java.
  I prefer C/C++ as a first language to be taught rather than Python or Java.
  Haskell is the most elegant language I have seen,
  but I rarely use it because I find pure functional programming difficult.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Text editor</strong>: Vim is my favorite. I haven't yet tried Emacs.</p>
</li>
