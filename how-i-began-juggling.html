        <p>Since childhood, juggling had captivated me and I always wanted to learn how to juggle.
However, all my initial attempts to learn it failed. It was so difficult.
I couldn't make any progress even when I tried for hours.</p>
<p>Then one day (in 2011, when I was around 16 years old),
I saw a documentary-ish thing on TV about juggling.
According to it, there are multiple ways of juggling. Those ways are called 'patterns'.
The pattern below is called the 'shower' pattern:</p>
<p><img alt="Shower pattern" src="https://sharmaeklavya2.github.io/blog/img/siteswaps/51.gif"></p>
<p>It turned out that shower is a difficult juggling pattern.
There's a juggling pattern easier than shower, called 'cascade':</p>
<p><img alt="Cascade pattern" src="https://sharmaeklavya2.github.io/blog/img/siteswaps/3.gif"></p>
<p>All my life, I had been trying to learn the shower
because that was the only juggling pattern I could imagine.
But as soon as I realized that cascade was easier, I tried learning that instead.
And this time I made some progress.
After around a week of practice, I could juggle for up to 10 seconds.</p>
<p>I don't remember why, but I didn't pursue juggling any further then.
I resumed it 3 years later.
I got better at cascade and then started learning other juggling patterns (including the shower).
Near the end of my first year at BITS (2014),
I bought juggling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggling_club">clubs</a>.
By October 2017, I knew around 25 patterns with 3 balls, 8 patterns with 4 balls, the 5-ball cascade
and 7 patterns with 3 clubs.</p>
<p>I didn't make much progress in 2016 and 2017.
I have been busy with studies and haven't been able to juggle regularly.</p>
<p>You can find videos documenting my juggling skills on youtube:
